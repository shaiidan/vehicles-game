# vehicles-game

During the second year of studying software engineering,
I built a vehicle game that allows you to select vehicles and transport them on the screen.

## game rules:
1. When the vehicles collides - the vehicle that collided with it is deleted. <br />
2. All vehicles except bike stop until you enter a "fuel" button. <br />
3. When the vehicle reaches one of the middle corners the game randomly decides where it will continue. <br />

I used design patterns like: 
Singleton, Memento, Factory Method 
<br />
